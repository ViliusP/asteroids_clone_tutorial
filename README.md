# Python tutorial website for Lithuanians

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/a81def38-4e1d-4e20-964e-5508cd98f65a/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/viliusp-pygame/deploys)

A pet project that serves as a fun and practical platform for teaching Python programming. Although currently intended for personal use, I may share it with educators and learners in the future.

Currently, it is developed simply, slowly, and iteratively in my free time. The philosophy of this project is 'if it works, it works.'
