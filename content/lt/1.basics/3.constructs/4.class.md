### Asteroidų analizė

#### Scenario:

You are part of a space research team analyzing data from an asteroid monitoring station. The station tracks asteroids approaching Earth and records the date, estimated size (in meters), distance from Earth (in kilometers), and velocity (in km/s) for each asteroid sighting.

You have historical data spanning 12 years, stored in CSV files named year1.csv to year12.csv. Each CSV file contains records with columns: Date, Size, Distance, Velocity.

Your task is to analyze this data to identify trends in asteroid activity over time, detect potentially dangerous asteroids, and predict the most likely month for future asteroid sightings.

Objectives:

- Identify the largest asteroid recorded each year.
- Determine which year had the most asteroid sightings.
- Calculate the average size of asteroids recorded each month across all years.
- Identify potentially dangerous asteroids: those with a size greater than 100 meters and a distance less than 500,000 km.
- Predict which month has the highest average number of asteroid sightings.

#### Input Data:

    12 CSV files named year1.csv to year12.csv with columns: Date, Size, Distance, Velocity.

Example content for year1.csv:

```csv
Date,Size,Distance,Velocity
2020-01-03,250,450000,25
2020-01-15,90,600000,18
2020-02-10,50,700000,22
...
```

#### Output data

A single result file named asteroid_analysis.txt containing:

- The largest asteroid recorded for each year.
- The year with the most asteroid sightings.
- The average asteroid size for each month (across all years).
- A list of potentially dangerous asteroids with details.
- The predicted month with the highest average sightings.


#### Functions

1. def read_all_asteroid_data(file_names: list) -> list[dict]
Reads all asteroid data from the provided CSV files and returns a list of records as dictionaries.

2. def identify_largest_asteroid(data: list[dict]) -> list[tuple]
Identifies the largest asteroid for each year and returns a list of tuples containing (year, date, size).

3. def find_year_with_most_sightings(data: list[dict]) -> int
Determines which year had the most asteroid sightings.

4. def calculate_monthly_average_size(data: list[dict]) -> dict
Calculates the average asteroid size for each month across all years and returns it as a dictionary.

5. def find_potentially_dangerous_asteroids(data: list[dict]) -> list[dict]
Identifies asteroids that are potentially dangerous based on size and distance criteria.

6. def predict_most_active_month(data: list[dict]) -> str
Predicts the month with the highest average number of asteroid sightings.

7. def write_asteroid_analysis(largest: list[tuple], most_sightings_year: int, monthly_average: dict, dangerous_asteroids: list[dict], active_month: str) -> None
Writes the analysis results to asteroid_analysis.txt.
